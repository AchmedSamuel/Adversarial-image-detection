# Adversarial-image-detection
A repository of jupyter notebooks on the paper **"Explainable AI for detection of adversarial machine learning via UMAP and open data"** on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets authored by Koroma A.S., Narteni S., Cambiaso E., & Mongelli M.
Attacking techniques like fast sign gradient methods, Carlini-Wagner method and projected gradient descent method are investigated by the embeddings of both legitimate and malicious MNIST and CIFAR dataset via UMAP for different dimension reduction.
