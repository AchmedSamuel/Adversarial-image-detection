# Adversarial-image-detection
A repository of jupyter notebooks on adversarial machine learning on image detection using image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR.
Attacking techniques like fast sign gradient methods, Carlini-Wagner method and projected gradient descent method are investigated by the embeddings of both legitimate and malicious MNIST and CIFAR dataset via UMAP for different dimension reduction. 


Achmed Samuel Koroma, Sara Narteni , Enrico Cambiaso and Maurizio Mongelli are the authors of **"Explainable AI for detection of adversarial machine learning via
UMAP and open data"**.
